# AnyLogic-JSONifier
A simple library for enabling JSON serialization and deserialization for various AnyLogic types, usable both as an add-on library inside AnyLogic (i.e., as an object you drag into your model) or inside any external editor (i.e., programmaticly created).

A customizable filter is available when converting objects to JSON - in a blacklist or whitelist mode - when you want to be able to specify what objects are/are not allowed in the output.

For when inside AnyLogic contexts, you can convert JSON strings or files to agents or populations, allowing for customized ways to initialize your model with.
